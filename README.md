# prg556-hotel-project
Final project for our Internet Programming and Distributed Computing course

This was my Internet Programming and Distributed Computing final project. It is a Java-based web application that I worked on with my partner Haley. The details of who created which files are at the top of each file.

This application is a mock up of a hotel website called the Peanut Hotel. The website allows previously created users to login and access their reservation. If they do not have any reservations in their name at the moment, they will be allows to reserve any available rooms of their choice. The user and password lists, along with the reservation list are saved in the database files(.db) in the repository. However, these files have not been added as the focus of this repository is mainly on the coding.

In order to run the project, you will first need to first need to open up Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and set up the databases. You can also use Oracle Database as an alternative. Lastly, you will also need to set up the database with your desired Java application server.
